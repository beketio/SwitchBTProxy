# Custom Classic BT HID Component (name tbd)

EZ C++ OO wrapper for the BT HID api

Currently uses the esp_hid component but will eventually only use the bt_hh_api and (soon) the bt_hd_api.

The esp-idf framework doesn't prove an api for a BT Classic device yet so it's using a custom component (WIP)

Supposedly official support is coming in v4.4 soon(tm)
